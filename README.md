# Tetris

if you want to build the project yourself:
download all the files put them into a single folder, and take Tetris.exe out of the folder.
make sure to have g++ and make installed, navigate to the directory and just run make, it should spit out the exe file.

If you want to just play it:
just run Tetris.exe
